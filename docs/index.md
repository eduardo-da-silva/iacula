# iacula :pray:	

This is an application that aims to help keeping God's presence. In short, the application presents, in customizable time intervals, short sentences for prayer (known as jaculatory). Also, images are presented that help elevate the soul in prayer.

The jaculatories are organized by days, according to traditional days of devotion in the Catholic Church, as follows:

- **Sunday**: Holy Trinity
- **Mondays**: Souls in purgatory
- **Tuesdays**: Holy Angels
- **Wednesdays**: St. Joseph
- **Thursdays**: Blessed Sacrament
- **Fridays**: Passion of the Christ
- **Saturdays**: Our Lady
